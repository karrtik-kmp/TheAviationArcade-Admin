# Admin tasks

## Done

- 2026-11-05: Split from the website repo (commit `cb16530`). Admin pages, admin API routes and a
  copy of the common modules; public pages, public routes and their tests removed. `/` redirects to
  `/admin`; `AdminShell` replaces `PublicShell`. Verified locally: `npm run typecheck` passed,
  `npm test` 344/344 passed, `vinext build` completed. The Cloudflare packaging step after the build
  stopped for missing local Firebase settings (no `.dev.vars` in this new checkout). Not run in a
  browser yet.

## Next

- [ ] Run the Admin locally against the auth emulator and walk sign-in, each desk and sign-out.
- [ ] Node server build and `SITE_SURFACE`-free start for the Hostinger server (the hosting brief
      assumed one repo; `server/web-deploy.sh` and the brief need an Admin repo and deploy key).
- [ ] Create the GitHub repo and add the remote (user).
- [ ] Remove the copied modules the Admin doesn't use once the website side is trimmed: community
      branches in `AuthForm`, `audiences.photographer/player`, `lib/submissions/export.ts`.
- [ ] Give the Admin's dev server its own port so both can run side by side.
- [ ] Decide how the copied common modules are kept in step (README lists them).
